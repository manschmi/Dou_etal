RNAseq and CLIP Analysis for Dou et al.


Analysis contains these parts:


(1) RNAseq:
All Analysis concerning knock-down total RNAseq data, essentially the exon count effect in Figure 5



(2) Analysis of CLIP:

2.1 subRead_annotation: assign first vs last exons etc to annotations used

2.2 CLIP_gene_scaled_metagene_plots: metagene analysis at the gene level

2.3 CLIP_exon_scaled_metagene_plots: metagene analysis at the exon level

2.4 NCBP3_PARCLIP_STARmap_TC_conversions_metagene: positioning of T to C conversions in NCBP3 PARCLIP dataset
